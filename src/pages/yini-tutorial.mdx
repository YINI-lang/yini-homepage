YINI makes configs readable for humans *and* consistent for machines — like INI, but with **real structure**, arrays, objects, and comments.

# Quick Tutorial: YINI Basics

## 1) What is YINI (in one line)?
A human-friendly config format (like INI) **with real structure**: sections, clear nested sections, arrays, objects, and unambiguous, predictable rules.

---

## 2) Create your first file

Make a file named **`config.yini`** and paste:

```yini
^ App
name = "Demo"
version = "1.0.0"
features = ["search", "dark-mode"]  // comments are allowed

^ Server
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

^^ Logging
enabled = false
```

## 💡 What's happening
- `^` starts a section. More carets = nested section (`^^ Logging` is inside `Server`).
- `key = value` defines a setting.
- Arrays (lists): `[1, 2, 3]`, objects: `{ key: value }`.
- Comments: `//` (also `#` including a space after).

---

## 3) Validate your config (in CLI)
From your terminal (make sure you are in the dir where you've saved your file), type:
```bash
npx yini --help
npx yini validate ./config.yini
```

You should see something like:

```bash
✅ Validation passed — 0 errors, 0 warnings.
```

You should see a success message (non-zero exit means a problem).
Use this in **CI** to catch config mistakes early:

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "config:check": "yini validate ./config.yini"
  }
}
```

Run with:
```bash
npm run config:check
```

### ⚠️ Common Questions 

#### Does indentation matter? 
No — indentation is only for readability.  
Structure is determined by section markers (`^`, `^^`, etc.), not spaces.

#### Can I mix comment styles?
Yes — YINI supports both `//` and `#` inline comments, preferrably only use one (inline comment) style per file for consistency.

## ✅ You just wrote and validated your first YINI config!
That's the basics.
