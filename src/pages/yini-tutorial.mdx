# Quick Tutorial: YINI Basics

## 1) What is YINI (in one line)?
A human-friendly config format (like INI) **with real structure**: sections, arrays, objects, and clear, predictable rules.

---

## 2) Create your first file

Make a file named **`config.yini`** and paste:

```yini
^ App
name = "Demo"
version = "1.0.0"
features = ["search", "dark-mode"]  # comments are allowed

^ Server
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

^^ Logging
enabled = false
```

**What's happening:**
- `^` starts a section. More carets = nested section (`^^ TLS` is inside `Logging`).
- `key = value` pairs hold data.
- Arrays (lists): `[ ... ]`, objects: `{ key: value }`.
- Comments: `#` (also `;` and `//`).

---

## 3) Validate it (CLI)
If you have the CLI:
```bash
npx yini --help
npx yini validate ./config.yini
```

You should see a success message (non-zero exit means a problem).
Use this in **CI** to catch config mistakes early:

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "config:check": "yini validate ./config.yini"
  }
}
```

Run with:
```bash
npm run config:check
```

Common mistakes (quick fixes)
- **"Indenting matters?"** — Normal whitespace is ignored outside strings; use it for readability.
