# About YINI

**YINI** is a new configuration format (formalized in 2025) designed for **clarity**, **easy nesting**, and **predictable validation**.

<a href="/get-started" class="btn btn-primary"> Get Started </a>

The format's syntax and behavior are defined in the **YINI Specification**, currently at **Version 1.0 — Candidate Release**.

YINI was created and is maintained by Marko K. Seppänen as an open-source project under the **YINI-lang** organization on GitHub. The specification, tooling, and ecosystem are actively evolving toward the first stable release.

YINI is a practical rethink of classic INI: the same friendly feel, but with **real structure**—sections, arrays, objects, and clear rules—while staying easy to read and write.
