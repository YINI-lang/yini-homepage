# YINI — Frequently Asked Questions

A quick, practical FAQ for the YINI configuration format. If you're new, start with [Get Started](/get-started) and try the [Playground](/playground).

---

## But, why exactly another config format like YINI?

**YINI** was created to offer a modern, structured, and readable configuration language that feels familiar — yet removes many of the historical inconsistencies of INI and YAML.

It aims to combine **simplicity, structure, and safety**:

- **Familiar and readable** – Uses indentation and key-value pairs like INI, so it's immediately understandable.
- **Structured and nestable** – Supports nested sections, lists, and objects cleanly, without indentation guessing or syntax ambiguity.
- **Strict when you need it** – Optional strict mode enforces spec-compliance for reliable configs in production environments.
- **Relaxed when you don't** – Lenient mode lets you parse partial or loosely formatted files without breaking your workflow.
- **Comment-friendly and human-first** – Keeps support for `;`, `#`, `//`, and even block comments (`/* */`) for maximum readability.
- **Fully defined specification** – Unlike traditional INI, YINI has an explicit, versioned grammar and spec, making it predictable across implementations.

## Why not just use INI/JSON/YAML/TOML?

Use whatever suits your project best. YINI aims to:

- Keep **INI-like simplicity**.
- Add **clear structure** (sections, arrays, objects).
- Keep **predictable rules** (strict mode available).
- Be **comfortable to read and diff**.

---

## What file extension should I use?

YINI documents uses the `.yini` file extension.

---

## How does sections look like?

Each section starts with `^`. (Settings are grouped in sections.)

Start a section with `^` and then a name **without spaces**, e.g.:

```ts
^ App
title = "AppName"
```

Here the text "App" is the section name.

### How to do several sections

One can add more sections, for example:

```ts
^ App
title = "My App Title"
items = 25

^ Style
isDarkTheme = OFF
```

---

## Can I use comments alongside values?

Yes, various commenting styles are supported in YINI:

```ts
// This is a line comment

timeout = 30  // inline comment

# This is also a line comment (must have a space after #)

interval = 30  # inline comment (must have a space after #)

/* Block comment spanning
   multiple lines */

; Full line comment (must be whole line).
```

---

## Are tabs and whitespace important?

No (in the sence as in Python or in Yaml).

**In YINI, spaces and tabs don't change meaning** - indentation is just for human readability.

---

## How to make another section in a section?

Use `^` at the start of a line to make a section, then add one more `^` to make a sub-section. Add yet another `^` to nest more sections into each other.

- `^` = section
- `^^` = sub-section
- `^^^` = sub-sub-section

Example:

```ts
    ^ App
      name = 'Demo'
      version = '1.0.0'

    ^ Database
      host = 'localhost'
      port = 5432

        // Add another caret `^` and you get a sub-section
        ^^ Credentials
           user = 'admin'
           password = "secret"
```

---

## Are keys case-sensitive?

Yes, keys and section names are **case-sensitive**. Keep a consistent style (e.g., `lower_snake_case`).

---

## What value types are supported?

Common scalars and collections:

- **Strings:** (classic/raw/triple-quoted, per spec)
- **Numbers:** (ints, floats, exponential)
- **Booleans:** `true`/`false`, plus `on`/`off` and `yes`/`no` (**all case-insensitive**)
- **Null:** `null` (**case-insensitive**)
- **Arrays:** `[1, 2, "str"]`
- **Objects:** `{ host: "db", port: 5432 }`

## Arrays and objects?

Yes and yes.

```ts
list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', true, null]

obj = { host: 'localhost', port: 5432 }
```
